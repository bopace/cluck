# cluck
2D platformer chicken adventure made in Unity

## The Game

Cluck is a fast-paced action platformer about a chicken armed with a leaf blower.

### Mechanics
* Jumping/flapping: Press space to jump. Pressing space subsequent times will flap your wings, slowing your fall and allowing you to glide further than jumping alone.
* Wall sliding/jumping: When falling adjacent to a wall, face it to slow your descent. Jump while sliding to kick off the wall. Chain jumps together to climb up obstacles.
* Leaf blower
** Press x to suck enemies and items toward you. Pick up rocks by sucking them into you.
** Press z to push enemies and items away from you. If you have picked up a rock, press z to shoot it towards enemies.
** Press shift to give yourself a boost while jumping.
* Slopes: Run up slopes to give you a height boost. Couple this with a jump to give yourself a huge boost.
